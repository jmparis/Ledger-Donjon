We hooked an oscilloscope to a chip we  found on the floor near the entrance of the Crypto-Party. It executes what looks like the public key computation on secp256r1 from some static secret, but it seems we can specify the input point  though...And it's definitely a Montgomery Ladder. That secret in there must give us access to free cryptodrinks, surely?
