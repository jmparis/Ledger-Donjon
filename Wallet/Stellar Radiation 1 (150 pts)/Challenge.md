# Stellar Radiation 1
## 150 points

We sent a payment device in the ISS so that astronauts can order pizzas.

A cryptoprocessor is used to limit power consumption. It seems its hash module is defective: our engineers suppose that, due to stellar radiations, some bytes it outputs are erased.

This device computes Stellar transactions. Can you retrieve its private key? Our astronauts are starving!
