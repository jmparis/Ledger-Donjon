# AirDrop 1
## 100 points

A new crypto-currency appeared a few days ago, which relies on a secure AirDrop service to send physical coins to its users. They work thanks to devices which are dispatched all over the world in order to provide secure delivery. Some attackers managed to steal the firmware of the device. They seem to implement a password-based authentication. With the firmware, it should be easy to crack the password.
