# AirDrop 2
## 300 points

A new crypto-currency appeared a few days ago, which relies on a secure AirDrop service to send physical coins to its users. They work thanks to devices which are dispatched all over the world in order to provide secure delivery.

Some attackers managed to steal the firmware of the device. They say that their supply-chain was probably breached by other nation-state attackers, as the firmware contains a back door to send the coins somewhere else.

What parameters are used by this back door?
