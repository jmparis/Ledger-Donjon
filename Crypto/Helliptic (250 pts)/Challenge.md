I developed a new messaging app for my final year project, when I was under graduate (I didn't have time to contribute to it since, though). I think it's pretty secure; every messages are encrypted and if users don't trust the server, they can use end-to-end encryption.

To prove the security of this app, I sent a message to `jane` (her password is `VwtL3nd2F!L`) and I'm sure no one will be able to decrypt it.

Feel free to reach out to me (`markz`) if you have any question.
