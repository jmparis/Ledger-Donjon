# Trusted Cloud 1

Our favorite cloud hosting provider now enables linking virtual machines with network TPM (Trusted Platform Module). We moved our infrastructure to passwordless full-disk encryption, which is great!

But recently we became aware of attackers who managed to compromise our storage and network. We thought we would be protected against such attacks, but apparently not :'(

We know that the attacker had access to the following disk image and network capture. What flag does the disk contain?

The disk image is available on https://cdn.donjon-ctf.io/machine.qcow2
